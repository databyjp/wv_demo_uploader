## UNOFFICIAL Weaviate demo data uploader

This is an educational project that aims to make it easy to upload demo data to your instance of [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io). The target audience is developers learning how to use Weaviate. 

## Usage

All datasets are based on the `Dataset` superclass, which includes a number of built-in methods to make it easier to work with it. 

Once you instantiate a dataset, to upload it to Weaviate the syntax is as follows:

```python
import weaviate_datasets
dataset = weaviate_datasets.JeopardyQuestionsSmall()  # Instantiate dataset
dataset.upload_dataset(client)  # Add class to schema & upload objects (uses batch uploads by default)
```

Where `client` is the instantiated `weaviate.Client` object.

```python
import weaviate
import os
import json

wv_url = "https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network"
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

auth = weaviate.AuthClientPassword(
    username=os.environ.get("WCS_USER"),
    password=os.environ.get("WCS_PASS"),
)

client = weaviate.Client(
    url=wv_url,
    auth_client_secret=auth,
    additional_headers={"X-OpenAI-Api-Key": api_key},
)
```

### Built-in methods

- `.add_to_schema(client)` - add defined classes to schema; returns status & any classes already present
- `.upload_objects(client, batch_size)` - adds objects; must specify batch size
- `.upload_dataset(client)` - runs `.add_to_schema` and `.upload_objects`; default batch size 100

- `.get_class_definitions()`: See the schema definition to be added
- `.get_class_names()`: See class names in the dataset
- `.classes_in_schema(client)`: Check whether each class is already in the Weaviate schema
- `.delete_existing_dataset_classes(client)`: If dataset classes are already in the Weaviate instance, delete them from the Weaviate instance.
- `.set_vectorizer(vectorizer_name, module_config)`: Set the vectorizer and corresponding module configuration for the dataset. Datasets come pre-configured with a vectorizer & module configuration.
