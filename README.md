## UNOFFICIAL Weaviate demo data uploader

This is an educational project that aims to make it easy to upload demo data to your instance of [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io). The target audience is developers learning how to use Weaviate.

## Usage

```shell
pip install -U weaviate-demo-datasets
```

Each dataset includes a default vectorizer configuration for convenience.
The target Weaviate instance must include the specified vectorizer module.

Once you instantiate a dataset, you can upload it to Weaviate with the following:

```python
import weaviate_datasets as wd
dataset = wd.JeopardyQuestions1k()  # Instantiate dataset
dataset.upload_dataset(client)  # Pass the Weaviate client instance
```

Where `client` is the instantiated `weaviate.WeaviateClient` object, such as:

```python
import weaviate
import os

client = weaviate.connect_to_local(
    headers={"X-OpenAI-Api-Key": os.getenv("OPENAI_APIKEY")}
)
```

To use a `weaviate.Client` object, as used in the Weaviate Python client `v3.x`, import the dataset class from `weaviate_datasets.v3`.

```python
import weaviate_datasets.v3_datasets as wd_v3
dataset = wd_v3.JeopardyQuestions1k()  # Instantiate dataset
dataset.upload_dataset(client)  # Pass the Weaviate client instance
```

### Built-in methods
- `.upload_dataset(client)` - add defined classes to schema, adds objects
- `.get_sample()` - yields sample data object(s)

## Available classes

- Wiki100 (Top 100 Wikipedia articles)
  - `WikiChunk` collection
  - Various chunking options available:
    - Default: `wiki_sections` (sections of the Wikipedia article)
    - `wiki_section_chunked` (sections of the Wikipedia article, chunked into 200 character chunks)
    - `wiki_heading_only` (only the headings of the Wikipedia article sections)
    - `fixed` (fixed length chunks of 200 characters)
  - Use it as follows:
    ```python
    d = wd.Wiki100()
    d.collection_name = "WikiChunk"
    d.set_chunking("wiki_section_chunked")
    upload_responses = d.upload_dataset(client, overwrite=True)
    ```
